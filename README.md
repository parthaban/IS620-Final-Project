## A Better Sentiment Analysis System

####Author: Partha Banerjee, CUNY MSDA

>** Final Project Requirement **
>
> "Your project should incorporate one or both of the two main themes of this course: network analysis and text processing. You need to show all of your work in a coherent workflow, and in a reproducible format, such as an IPython Notebook or an R Markdown document. If you are building a model or models, explain how you evaluate the “goodness” of the chosen model and parameters."

This project is to create a *model* which will be able to analyze the sentiment more accurately. The target is to train the model to predict “not cool” as negative instead of positive as predicted by majority of the models due to the positive word “cool”.

As you all know, sentiment analysis helps modern business many ways - a prospect buyers can use the sentiments of other buyers to decide about the product (s)he is planning to buy, producers can plan about their product lines based upon buyers sentiment, producers can take corrective measures to address negative sentiment about their product, marketers can use this for their research and recommendation etc. Social media like twitter, facebook play an important role to spread this sentiment very quickly.

In this project, I will first build the model and test its accuracy. Then I will get twitter data based upon user given hashtag and check their sentiment using the model. This project will comply the Project Requirements as follows:

* This is a text processing project.
* It is reproducible, written in IPython. I will share everything except my twitter credentials.
* I will also include the twitter data in .TXT format. This is to support the situation if twitter is unavailable (due to credentials etc.)
* Compare among different conditions and model's behavior.
* Finally, to deliver a model which can identify "not cool" as negative, not positive.
